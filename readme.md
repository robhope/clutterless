## Frequently Asked Questions

### I can’t code at all, how much can I change on the theme?
- The theme utilizes WordPress’s Theme Customizer. You can change text color, link color, sidebar color, browser background color and lots more. [See setup video](https://onepagelove.com/go/clutterless-setup).

### How is Clutterless v2 different from v1?
1. Removed most of the AJAX wizardry (except loading archives), it didn't play nice with plugins and felt more gimicky than useful. 
2. Stripped out a few things to simplify it to be a One Page first theme (simply read and load more posts at bottom), it can be turned into a standard blog when tweaking a few theme settings within the Customizer.
3. A new set of fonts.
4. Better options like font switching within the Customizer (coming soon)
5. There is no longer any support for comments (this could be a future addition, it's simple for now)
6. Improved code in every way.

### How can a blog be a One Page WordPress theme?
- There are no links pages or posts on the Home page, the theme is designed to be an uninterrupted reading experience starting from the newest posts. You can create of course create pages if you wish. There is also a theme setting to link to posts just like a normal blog.

### What about SEO? How do search bots crawl the site?
- All the titles in the archives link to the post which allow a crawl and index. Also direct links are there to share, no problem, see [this page link](https://demo.onepagelove.com/clutterless/clutterless-focuses-on-content/).
